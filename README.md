# Urdu-Compiler
A native (Urdu) Language Compiler.

This program provides an interface to write code in Urdu language, I used a GCC compiler to compile C++ code.
The basic structure of the compiler looks like:

Which makes very easy to create a new language compiler just by connecting new language instead of previous language.

Anyway, the point I am trying to make is, it is very easy if you want to create your own language compiler using the current code.
